Gherkin/Cucumber
Calabash
{
	Calabash-iOS and Calabash-Android are the underlying low-level libraries that empower the Cucumber tool to run automated functional tests 

	Cucumber lets you express the behavior of your app using natural language that can be understood by business experts and non-technical QA staff


	Although we focus on Cucumber, Calabash can be used to write automated functional and acceptance tests using any Ruby-based test framework.
}

Calabash provide the Ruby API to make up the steps.
